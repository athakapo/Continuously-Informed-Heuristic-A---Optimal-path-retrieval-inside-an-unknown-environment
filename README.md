## Main objective

The developed algorithm ensures the optimal path retrieval between **two given locations** by exploring the **minimum portion of the environment**.

*The term **minimum portion of the environment** is defined as the number of cells that have to be visited by the explorer (robot-scouter) to acquire information about the state (obstacle or free space) of their neighbors.*

## Optimality guarantee

In principle, the optimal path can be guaranteed by a searching agent that adopts an A*-like decision mechanism. The proposed CIA* inherits the A* optimality and efficiency guarantees, while at the same time exploits the learnt formation of the obstacles, to on-line revise the heuristic evaluation of the candidate states.
